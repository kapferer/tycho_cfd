TYCHO is a multidimensional (1D/2D and 3D) compressible hydrodynamics code written in C and parallelized with OpenMP.
A Lagrangian remap version of the Piece-wise Parabolic Method developed by Paul Woodward and Phil Colella (1984) is applied.
The code is based on the freely available VH-1 package. The simulation package is focused on wind-flow experiments with obstacles in it and advection of marker fields for investigating obstacle-gas interactions. In addition momenta and their direction on obstacles are calculated.
Thermal diffusion on obstacles, thermal-exchange between obstacles and the surrounding gas and a Sutherland's-law viscosity routine can be switched on in. Gravity is included as a constant background-field and a stratified atmosphere can be set up, if needed. In this version a new sound emitter module is integrated, so TYCHO is able to calculate dB-maps.

TYCHO is freely available to everyone. You are welcome to download it and do whatever you want with it.

This is version V1.3.0
(October 2013)

After extracting 

./configure
make 
make install

if you use the GNU Compilers and you want use OpenMP parallelism the following configure arguments should work

./configure CFLAGS=”-O3 -fopenmp” LIBS=”-lm -lgomp”


Important notice: If you have old parameterfiles, you have to change them due to TYCHO's new parameterfile-format. Have a look into the manual and into the parameterfile directory to see what has changed.

Initial conditions generated with tychoBCGEN V0.3 do not work anymore, please use tychoBCGEN V0.4 or later to generate them.
Mayor improvements are done, especially in speedup the code.

If you want to make some example simulations, be aware to point to the initial conditions in the example directory in your directory tree and to choose your output directory.

Have fun
